WHAT IS FOOTBALL?
Football, which is also often referred to as soccer outside the UK and association
football throughout Europe, is a game of two teams and one ball – the football.
Each team has 11 players and, using all parts of their bodies apart from their arms and hands,
must try to get the ball into the other team’s goal.

The goal is, typically, a large rectangular frame with a net attached to the back. However,
amateur games often just use markers such as traffic cones or, if you’re a teenager,
sweaters or bags. When it’s not professional football, the rules are often relaxed.

It’s the goalkeeper’s job to stop the football going into the net. Each team has a goalkeeper
who, as an exception, can use their hands to obstruct the ball. Although, they’re only allowed
to do so in the penalty area – a small area in front of and around the goal.

In football, the team that scores the most goals by the end of the game wins. The standard
length of a game is 90 minutes with a short break, known as ‘half time’, at the 45-minute mark.
However, youth football games are often shorter – typically, they only last 45-60 minutes.

WHERE CAN YOU PLAY FOOTBALL?
Professional football games always take place on a full-size pitch, which must measure
90-120 metres (m) in length, with a width of 45-90m. However, football can be played anywhere.

Since the game was first played, it has been played in the streets, gardens, community areas,
school halls and even in war zones.

One of the most famous examples of football being played under unlikely circumstances
in the First World War and the Christmas truce of 1914, where German and British armed forces
left their trenches and entered No Man’s Land, where they’re reported to have played football
and sung carols for just one day, before resuming fighting.
